# Secret-number
A short game to guess a secret number
The number should be in the range of 0â€“10, randomly generated by the program. The program will accept a number as INPUT. A maximum of three guesses will be allowed. On the first and second attempt the program will inform the user if they should go higher or lower. If the number is guessed correctly, then a message of congratulations will be displayed.
